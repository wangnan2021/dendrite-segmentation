# dendrite-segmentation
This repository contains semantic image segmentation models used for dendrite segmentation of radiographs acquired from the solidification process of metallic alloys. Those models were mentioned in the article “Dynamic evolution of microstructure morphology in thin-sample solidification: Deep learning assisted synchrotron X-ray radiography”.
